The value of new AI tools lies in its ability to take large amounts of data and glean insights, actions, and other buzzwordy things from that without you having to lift a finger.  The only downside is that that “data”, in order to be valuable, needs to be your meeting notes, your emails, your calendar, your vital personal data that would be terrifying if anyone else got access to. And we all seem ok throwing this data into [other people’s clouds](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-cloud-is-just-someone-elses-computer/) without a care because these tools make it so easy to do so — their business model requires you to trust before you think.

I wonder how far away from a massive data leak or breach of trust issue with any of these tools, especially given the rise of AI-powered software development and “vibe coding” leading to hastily built apps. These apps which are just three LLMs in a trench coat, are [raising huge valuations](https://cognition.ai/blog/windsurf) and [funding rounds](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/lovable-becomes-a-unicorn-with-200m-series-a-just-8-months-after-launch/) which further increases the perception of trustworthiness in these tools. “Everyone else is using it, why shouldn’t I”.

It’s hard to argue with the ease of use these tools provide, and when they do their job well it definitely feels like magic, but I find it hard to overlook the potential for disaster.
