I'm an Engineering Manager based in Edinburgh, UK, currently working for [Skyscanner](https://skyscanner.net).

I manage teams, coach and develop great software engineers, and build full-stack applications using wide range of technologies including NodeJs, React, Python, Java, and various AWS technologies.

Outside of work I spend my time teaching @ [Code First:Girls](https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/) and mentoring @ [codebar.io](https://codebar.io).
