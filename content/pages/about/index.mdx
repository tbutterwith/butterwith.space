I'm an engineering manager based in Edinburgh, UK, currently working for <a href="https://skyscanner.net">Skyscanner</a>.

I manage teams, coach and develop great software engineers, and build full-stack applications using wide range of technologies including NodeJs, React, Python, Java, and various AWS technologies.

Outside of work I spend my time teaching @ <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">Code First:Girls</a> and mentoring @<a href="https://codebar.io">codebar.io</a>.
